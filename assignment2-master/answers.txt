1. O(1) since the random numbers being put into the array will take a constant
amount of time based on the constant value of the array length.

2. O(n) because O(n) of the linear search grows faster than the O(log n) of the
binary search and is therefore closer to the function's possible upper bounds.

4. Tuple, Tie, and with structs
